Dynamic Shadows 

## User Stories

* As a Craft user I want shadows that move with the texture blocks in order
to have a more immersive experience. 

* As a Craft user I want tree and plant blocks to cast dynamic shadows in order to create a more immersive experience.

* As a Craft user I want the shadows to move with the sun's position 
so that I can see where the shadow's source is coming from.

* As a Craft user I want to have a sun as a light source 
so that I can have a more realistic experience.
